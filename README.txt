Title: QGIS Huff Model Script
Version: 1.0

Purpose:
In its own right, interpreting trade areas are quite difficult; adding to that difficulty, is the accessibility to software that can help users accomplish such a task. One method that has been locked behind cost-prohibitive software would be the Huff model. This program attempts to amend such an issue. Using QGIS as a foundation, and Python the basics of the Huff model was transformed into a relatively easy to use piece of software. 
 

Note:
This program was initially created in January 2018. There are many areas to improve, the biggest of which would be to turn the script into a more accessible plugin that can be downloaded via the official QGIS plugin repository. Another area of improvement would be debugging.
